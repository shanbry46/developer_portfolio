# Test Plan

**Author**: Team 75

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy
*This section should provide details about your unit-, integration-, system-, and regression-testing strategies. In particular, it should discuss which activities you will perform as part of your testing process, and who will perform such activities.*

Our unit testing will test expected and unexpected (such as invalid values) inputs to each unit. These will be run manually by the developers. As tests are passed, more can be written to further test existing features and add new ones.    

Our integration testing will check that each piece of functionality of the app works as expected and that the UI for each view is functional and returns expected values. These will be run by the developers.

Our system tests will test all workflows to ensure the complete app functions as expected for any action the user takes.  These will be run manually by our developers.

For regression testing, we will keep a log of passed test cases and will retest manually if required.  System testing will be performed when the app is complete or nearly complete, but will be completely repeated for any workflow in which any of the code was modified. 

### 1.2 Test Selection
*Here you should discuss how you are going to select your test cases, that is, which black-box and/or white-box techniques you will use. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*
  
Most of our testing will be white-box as unit and integration tests. These will be performed as statement coverage and branch coverage tests, which will make up the bulk of our test cases.

As for black-box testing, we will use boundry value testing at all levels that take numeric or text input to ensure invalid values are rejected while valid values are processed. 

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
*Define how you are going to assess the quality of your test cases. Typically, this involves some form of functional or structural coverage. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

We will determine that our unit and integration testing is adaquate by ensuring that it covers all non-trivial sections of our code. Units and functions containing them are regression tested whenever that unit is modified.   

### 1.4 Bug Tracking
*Describe how bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked.*

Bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked as issues in github.

### 1.5 Technology
*Describe any testing technology you intend to use or build (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).*

If more time was permitted to complete the assignment, we would use JUnit and espresso for our unit and integration testing. Given that this is a small app, the system testing will be done manually.

## 2 Test Cases

*This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.*
